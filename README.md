## About the Book

### Summary

The *Guide to Markdown Mode for Emacs* aims to be a complete reference for the [`markdown-mode`](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/) package for users and developers.  It will include more detailed basic documentation: installation instructions, configuration, and movement and editing commands.  However, since it is a book it will go into more detail about the *Emacs way* of editing as it relates to Markdown.  Additionally, the book will cover more advanced usage topics, such as subtree and structure editing, defun and page movement, marking, narrowing, region management, imenu, etc..  It will cover interaction with other packages, such as CriticMarkup mode, Pandoc mode, Deft, Polymode, HTML as Markdown mode, and more.  Finally, it will contain tips and tricks for custom configuration options such as custom CSS stylesheets, using pre- and post-processors, custom faces, creating a local wiki, and syntax highlighting of code blocks.
